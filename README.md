# lakeview-map-sbox

This map is my first attempt at mapping in general, especially in Source 2 / S&box

This map is a heavy work in progress, expect bugs, unfinished areas and un-optimized areas.

I use ambientCQ textures which are licensed uner the Creative Commons License.

# Current Features:

Absoulutely shit all...

I am currently working on a medium sized apartment block / hotel, this is the first area that is "playable"
